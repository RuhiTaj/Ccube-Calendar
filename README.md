# Code-Contest-Calendar
	In todayâ€™s growing coding cultures, coding sites have really taken over gaming sites. Each coding competition organized by each website has its own unique mark. Considering the huge number of websites, it has become really hard for the coders to keep track of the various contests and the contests which are apt to their level of skills in coding. In order to overcome the current problem, the idea of code contest calendar is strong. 
In this project, the data of the coding competitions is collected from all the websites and stored in SQL database for proper management and retrieval. Also, the competitions will be sorted according to their dates like a calendar and the user can view present, past and future contests with ease. Each coding website will be categorized using ML techniques and stored in the SQL database. SQL will be used for easy retrieval and recovery of data. Contests along with their dates will be stored and organized. Students can easily see the available contests. Machine learning and web crawler techniques will also be implemented.
